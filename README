This is a very early release of a code base developed by Jesse Weaver for
experiments in his research.  Very little documentation is provided, but I
(Jesse Weaver) got tired of telling people that I would open source this
code as soon as I had time to document it... a time that never seems to
come around.  So, at least it's available now.  Let's call it version 0.1.
Good luck.
